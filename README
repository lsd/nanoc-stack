----------

STRUCTURE

A site has the following files and directories:
  nanoc.yaml contains the site configuration
  Rules contains compilation, routing and layouting rules
  content/ contains the uncompiled items
  layouts/ contains the layouts
  lib/ contains custom site-specific code (filters, helpers, â€¦)
  output/ contains the compiled site
  tmp/ For speeding up compilation (can be safely emptied)


NOTES: lib/ dir
will load all Ruby files in lib before it starts compiling. 
All method definitions, class definitions, available during 
compilation process. This dir is quite useful for putting 
in site-wide helpers, filters, data sources, etc.
